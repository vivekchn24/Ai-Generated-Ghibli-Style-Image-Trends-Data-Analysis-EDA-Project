## **-->> 📌 Recommendations/Insights**

1.Most frequent prompt is Anime-Style train passing through a fantasy world with 2048×2048resolution, high GPU usage, very slow generation time, medium file size, excellent accuracy, no ethical concern, and mostly generated on March 3rd, 31st, and Sundays.

2.Twitter is the top platform with highest likes, comments, and shares especially for Studio Ghibli-Inspired Ocean with giant fish which also shows high GPU time and image accuracy.

3.Instagram hosts popular prompts like Ghibli-style night sky with glowing stars, Mysterious castle in the clouds, and Mysterious temple hidden in a magical forest with large file sizes and high accuracy.

4.Reddit features Ghibli-style content with high accuracy and larger image sizes, especially Ghibli-style village at sunset which also shows high GPU time.

5.TikTok hosts heavy prompts like Spirited Away style bustling market street and Serene meadow with a tiny spirit creature with highest image dimensions, large sizes, and longer generation times.

6.Most images were created in March 2025 with peak activity on Wednesdays, Fridays, Sundays, and Mondays based on likes, shares, comments, generation time, and accuracy.

7.Hand-edited images tend to get more likes and comments, especially when GPU time and generation time are high, while non-edited images receive higher shares.

8.Prompts with no ethical concern flags consistently receive higher likes, comments, and accuracy, but interestingly, flagged prompts tend to get more shares and longer generation times.

9.Ghibli-style mountain with floating islands is notable for high GPU usage, large file size, and high generation time with no ethical concerns or editing.

10.Across platforms, Studio Ghibli themed prompts dominate trends with high engagement,performance scores, and aesthetic preference.

11.'Ghibli-style','Mysterious','with' is the most common words while prompting.

12.Most common word in the top comments is 'Ghibli'.
